## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add brandan-schmitz https://brandan-schmitz.github.io/helm-charts/
```

You can then run `helm search repo brandan-schmitz` to see the charts.

A big thanks to [bjw-s-labs] for all the work on the library chart used to create these helm charts!
